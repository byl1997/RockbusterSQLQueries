Here are some SQL querys using a common table expression.

This CTE was used to find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers in the top 10 cities.

with average_paid (customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city) as
(select B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, E. country,D.city, sum (A.amount) as 
total amount_paid_to_rockbuster 
from payment A
  inner join customer B on A.customer_id = B.customer_id
  inner join address C on B.address_id = C.address_id
  inner join city D on C.city_id = D.city_id
  inner join country E on D.country_id=E.country_id
where city in ('Auora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule (Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki', 'Pingxiang',
               'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
group by B.customer_id,B.first_name, B.last_name, E. country,D.city
order by (total_amount_paid_to_rockbuster) desc
Limit 5)
select avg(total_amount_paid_to_rockbuster) as average 
from average_paid

This CTE was used to find the top 4 countreis with the highest top customer count and total customer
count.

with top_5_customers (customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city) as
  (select B.customer_id, B. first_name, B.last_name, E. country,D.city, sum (A. amount) 
  as total amount paid_to_rockbuster 
from payment A
  inner join customer B on A.customer_id B.customer_id
  inner join address C on B.address_id = C.address_id
  inner join city D on C.city_id = D.city_id
  inner join country E on D.country_id=E.country_id
where city in ('Auora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintaf', 'Adoni', 'Dhule (Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki', 'Pingxiang',
              'Sivas','Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
group by B.customer_id,B.first_name, B.last_name, E. country,D.city
order by (total_amount_paid_to_rockbuster) desc
Limit 5)
select E.country,
  count (distinct B.customer_id) as all_customer_count,
  count (distinct top_5_customers.customer_id) as top_customer_count
  from country E
  inner join city D on E. country_id=D.country_id
  inner join address C on D.city_id=c.city_id
  inner join customer B on C.address_id=8.address_id
  right join top_5_customers
